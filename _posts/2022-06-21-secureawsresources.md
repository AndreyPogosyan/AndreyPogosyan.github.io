To quote AWS documentation:

<b>A security group acts as a virtual firewall, controlling the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance.</b>

   Part of deploying AWS resources is understanding how to secure various applications and services. I believe at the base layer, security groups play a big part in providing a layer of security to the applications. It is very important that we donâ€™t forget to restrict access to the resources that are deployed in AWS, and ensuring only authorized communication can occur between these resources.
