* Hide Activities Button
* Sound Input & Output Device Chooser
* Tiling Assistant
* User Themes
* Vitals

## Terminal Theme

I am currently using PowerLevel10k for the gnome-terminal theme.

## Theme

<a href="https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1214931">Flat Remix</a> is my prefernece for the theme that I am currently using in Gnome. I also use the Oreo cursors look for the system cursor theme.
