Welcome to my blog! My name is Andrey and I am the content creator for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7P4QyfzBe0xpdblKVDb8w">APNetworX  YouTube</a> channel where we feature content around Linux, DevOps, Open Source, and more.

I created this site for the purpose of sharing my knowledge and documentating the different projects that I am either currently working on or projects that I just want to share with the community.
